# BaxterFaces (An Open Source Baxter Face Database)

Database of faces for the Rethink Robotics Baxter Research Robot, including Paul Ekman's facial expressions plus neutral, in seven different colors.

StudyFaceFiles - folder of core database images (the ones photographed on Baxter's face screen in the "Photographs" folder).
These images include sad, angry, disgusted, happy, afraid, surprised, and neutral expressions with red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and gray backgrounds.

Photographs - folder of images of each core database image published to Baxter's face screen. 
These photographs were used in an MTurk survey discussed in a 2016 ICSR paper about this database. The title of this paper is "Designing and assessing expressive open-source faces for the Baxter robot."

SourceFiles - folder of editable powerpoint files, in the case that researchers would like to adjust the images for their work.

BonusFaceFiles- by surveying Baxter users, we discovered interest in additional expressions and gaze coherences. These additional faces were not discussed in the paper, but they may be useful to researchers interested in more Baxter faces.
